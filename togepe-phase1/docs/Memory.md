## Project Overview

Pinitup is a Pinterest-inspired AI Prompt sharing platform where users can discover, save, organize and manage high-quality AI prompts.

## Current Stack

**Frontend:** React 18, Vite 5, JavaScript (JSX), Tailwind-free (inline styles + CSS files), Framer Motion, Lucide React icons, React Router v6, Axios

**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, JWT, Passport (Google OAuth), Cloudinary, Multer

**Deployment targets:** Vercel (client), Render (server)

## Completed Features

### Phase 1 — Auth + Core CRUD
- JWT authentication (register, login, Google OAuth)
- AuthContext with single-source-of-truth auth state (token, user, login, logout)
- ProtectedRoute component for route-level auth gating
- UserMenu component with avatar dropdown + logout
- Centralized axios instance with 401 interceptor routed through AuthContext
- Content CRUD (create, read, delete) with Cloudinary image upload
- Feed page with search, category filter, sort
- PromptDetail page
- Dashboard with stats, recent/trending prompts, quick actions
- Responsive Navbar + collapsible Sidebar layout
- ErrorBoundary, Toast, TagInput reusable components
- Seed admin script

### Phase 1 — Likes
- Backend: toggleLike with denormalized likesCount sync
- Backend: isLiked attachment via bulk Like query on content endpoints
- Frontend: LikeButton component (optimistic updates, spring animation)

### Phase 1 — Boards (Collections)
- Backend: Board model (owner, name, description, savedContent[], timestamps, unique owner+name index)
- Backend: Full CRUD — createBoard, getMyBoards, getBoardById, updateBoard, deleteBoard
- Backend: saveContentToBoard / removeContentFromBoard with duplicate prevention
- Backend: getMyBoards accepts optional `?contentId=X` query param — returns `isSaved` boolean per board
- Backend: getSavedContentIds endpoint — returns flat array of all content IDs saved across user's boards
- Backend: All routes protected with auth middleware, ownership checks on update/delete/save
- Frontend: SaveToBoardModal — toggle behavior (save/remove), shows checkmark for boards that already contain the prompt, optimistic UI updates, isSaved awareness via `?contentId=X`
- Frontend: BoardCard component (name, description, prompt count, edit/delete actions)
- Frontend: Boards page (list all user's boards, create/edit/delete modals, toast feedback)
- Frontend: BoardDetail page (view saved prompts, remove from board)
- Frontend: Filled BookmarkCheck icon on PromptCard/PromptDetail when prompt is saved to any board (persisted via /boards/saved-ids)
- Frontend: Save button added to PromptCard and PromptDetail with active state styling
- Frontend: Sidebar updated — "Categories" replaced with "Boards" link

### Auth Architecture (as of latest commit)
- `AuthProvider` wraps `<App />` in `main.jsx` — single source of truth
- `LoginPage` and `OAuthSuccess` call `AuthContext.login()` (no direct localStorage writes)
- `ProtectedRoute` wraps `/dashboard`, `/feed`, `/add-prompt`, `/prompt/:id`, `/boards`, `/boards/:id`
- `UserMenu` integrated into `Navbar` (replaces hardcoded avatar)
- `api.js` 401 interceptor delegates to `AuthContext.logout()`
- Dashboard and AddPromptPage no longer have duplicate `localStorage` auth guards

## Pending Features

- Admin dashboard UI
- User profile page
- Registration page (API exists, no UI)
- Guest browsing (limit to 5 prompts)
- Categories management page
- Settings page
- 404 page (currently redirects to /login)
- TailwindCSS integration (currently inline styles + CSS)

## Known Bugs

- None critical after auth refactor

## Decisions Taken

- AuthContext is the single owner of token/user state; no component touches localStorage directly
- ProtectedRoute handles all route-level auth; individual pages do not check tokens
- Google OAuth decodes JWT payload client-side for user info (no separate /me endpoint yet)
- Dark mode first design with glassmorphism
- No TypeScript — project uses plain JSX with Vite
- Likes use optimistic updates with server reconciliation; LikeButton handles its own API call and reverts on failure
- Content endpoints attach isLiked via bulk Like query (not aggregation pipeline) for simplicity
- Save to Board uses toggle behavior: checkmark = saved, clicking removes, optimistic UI updates
- Saved state persisted via `GET /boards/saved-ids` on page load (not session-only)
- Modal uses `?contentId=X` query param to get `isSaved` per board for accurate saved-state display

## Database Schema Summary

- **User:** name, email, passwordHash, role (user/admin), provider (local/google), googleId, avatar
- **Content:** type, mediaUrl, mediaPublicId, title, description, category, prompt, tags[], uploadedBy (ref User), likesCount, sharesCount
- **Board:** owner (ref User), name, description, savedContent[] (ref Content), timestamps, unique(owner, name) index — fully implemented
- **Like:** user (ref User), content (ref Content), unique compound index — fully implemented

## API Summary

- `POST /api/auth/register` — create account
- `POST /api/auth/login` — email/password login, returns JWT
- `GET /api/auth/google` — Google OAuth redirect
- `GET /api/auth/google/callback` — Google OAuth callback, redirects with token
- `POST /api/content` — create content (auth + multer upload)
- `GET /api/content` — list content (public, optional auth for guest limits)
- `GET /api/content/:id` — get single content
- `DELETE /api/content/:id` — delete content (auth required)
- `POST /api/likes/:contentId` — toggle like/unlike (auth required), returns `{ liked, likesCount }`
- `POST /api/boards` — create board (auth required)
- `GET /api/boards` — list current user's boards (auth required, optional `?contentId=X` to return `isSaved` per board)
- `GET /api/boards/saved-ids` — returns flat array of all content IDs saved across user's boards (auth required)
- `GET /api/boards/:id` — get board with saved prompts (auth required, ownership check)
- `PUT /api/boards/:id` — update board name/description (auth required, ownership check)
- `DELETE /api/boards/:id` — delete board (auth required, ownership check)
- `POST /api/boards/:id/save/:contentId` — save prompt to board (auth required, duplicate prevention)
- `DELETE /api/boards/:id/save/:contentId` — remove prompt from board (auth required)
- `GET /api/likes/ping` — working

## Current Phase

Phase 1 Complete — Auth + Likes + Boards + Core CRUD operational

## Next Tasks

1. Admin dashboard
2. User profile page
3. Registration UI
4. Guest browsing limits

## Daily Progress Log

### 2026-07-22
- Wired AuthProvider into main.jsx (was orphaned)
- Updated LoginPage and OAuthSuccess to use AuthContext.login() instead of direct localStorage
- Wrapped protected routes with ProtectedRoute in App.jsx
- Integrated UserMenu into Navbar (replaced hardcoded avatar)
- Removed duplicate auth guards from Dashboard and AddPromptPage
- Added catch-all route in App.jsx
- Verified clean build (vite build passes)
- **Likes feature implemented:**
  - Backend: likeController (toggleLike), likeRoutes wired with protect middleware
  - Backend: contentController now returns isLiked for authenticated users (getAllContent, getContentById)
  - Frontend: LikeButton component (reusable, optimistic updates, spring animation)
  - Frontend: LikeButton integrated into PromptCard (feed) and PromptDetail (detail page)
  - Frontend: Feed tracks likedIds Set and syncs state on toggle
  - Frontend: "Most Liked" sort works via existing likesCount sort
  - CSS: like-button styles with active/hover/small variants
  - Verified clean build
- **Boards feature implemented:**
  - Backend: Board model updated with description field + unique(owner, name) index
  - Backend: boardController — full CRUD (create, list, get, update, delete) + save/remove content
  - Backend: boardRoutes wired with protect middleware on all routes
  - Backend: ownership checks on get/update/delete/save operations
  - Backend: duplicate saved prompt prevention via manual check (not $addToSet for explicit error messages)
  - Frontend: SaveToBoardModal — fetches boards, pick existing or create new, save prompt
  - Frontend: BoardCard — name, description, prompt count, edit/delete actions
  - Frontend: Boards page — list all user's boards, create/edit/delete modals, toast feedback
  - Frontend: BoardDetail page — view saved prompts, remove from board, back navigation
  - Frontend: Save button added to PromptCard (like-row) and PromptDetail (actions bar)
  - Frontend: App.jsx updated with /boards and /boards/:id protected routes
  - Frontend: Sidebar "Categories" link replaced with "Boards" link
   - CSS: Boards.css (boards page, board cards, board detail, shared modal styles, save button)
   - Verified clean production build
- **Save to Board — toggle behavior + persisted saved state:**
   - Backend: `getMyBoards` accepts `?contentId=X` query param, returns `isSaved` boolean per board
   - Backend: `getSavedContentIds` endpoint — returns flat array of saved content IDs for current user
   - Backend: Route `/boards/saved-ids` registered before `/:id` to avoid collision
   - Frontend: SaveToBoardModal rewritten — toggle behavior (save/remove), checkmark on saved boards, optimistic updates
   - Frontend: PromptCard accepts `saved` prop, renders filled `BookmarkCheck` icon when saved
   - Frontend: PromptGrid passes `savedIds` Set through to PromptCard
   - Frontend: Feed fetches saved IDs on mount, tracks `savedIds` state, wires modal callback
   - Frontend: PromptDetail fetches saved IDs on mount, tracks `isSaved`, wires modal callback
   - Frontend: CSS — `.save-button--active` + modal saved-state classes (`.stm-board-item--saved`, etc.)
   - Bug fix: Added missing `X` import in Boards.jsx (was used in modals but not imported)
   - Verified clean production build
- **Like double-click race condition bug fix:**
   - Root cause: LikeButton used `useState` for `busy` flag; `setBusy(true)` is async, so a rapid double-click fires two API requests — first deletes the Like, second creates a new one, leaving the prompt liked with wrong count
   - Fix (frontend): Added `useRef` busy guard for synchronous duplicate-click prevention; `busyRef.current = true` executes before the second click can proceed
   - Fix (backend): `toggleLike` now recalculates `likesCount` via `Like.countDocuments()` instead of manual increment/decrement — self-heals any count drift from race conditions
   - Verified clean production build
- **Prompt delete feature:**
   - Root cause: Backend `DELETE /api/content/:id` endpoint existed and worked, but no frontend UI called it — the feature was never wired up
   - Frontend: PromptDetail page now shows a Delete button for the prompt's owner only (`isOwner` check via `uploadedBy._id === user._id`)
   - Frontend: Confirmation modal (reuses `.stm-*` shared modal classes) prevents accidental deletes
   - Frontend: On successful delete, shows success toast then navigates to `/feed` after 800ms
   - Frontend: Uses `useAuth()` to get current user for ownership check
   - CSS: Added `.prompt-detail__delete-btn` danger-variant styles
   - Verified clean production build

## Developer Notes

- All files are `.jsx`/`.js`, not TypeScript — follow existing convention
- No Tailwind — all styling is inline or CSS files
- Each page independently renders `<Navbar>` and `<Sidebar>` (no shared layout wrapper yet)
- Server runs on port 501, client on port 5173
